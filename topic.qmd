# Topic for My User Guide

For my user guide, I will focus on **anticipatory action and statistical trigger models used in humanitarian disaster response**. This topic comes from the sections of the Annual Review article that discuss forecast-based financing and early warning systems for natural hazards like floods, cyclones, and droughts.

Instead of covering all humanitarian statistics, I'm narrowing in on how analysts decide **when a forecast is strong enough to take action before a disaster happens**.

# Scope of the User Guide

The goal of this user guide is to act as a basic "how-to" manual for someone working in humanitarian organization who needs to help decide when to trigger early actions, such as releasing funds or pre-positioning supplies.

The guide will explain:

-   What anticipatory action is and how it differs from reacting after a disaster.

-   The types of data used to build trigger models (hazard forecasts, population data, past disaster impacts).

-   How trigger thresholds are chosen and what they represent.

-   How to think about false alarms vs. missed disasters when evaluating a trigger.

-   Situations where anticipatory action works well and situations where it probably should not be used.

-   Some basic ethical concerns, like how data quality and bias can affect who receives help first.

I would set yourself up with a hypothetical example -- you could probably get data from e.g. weather forecasts before and during a hurricane or the 2021 Texas freeze or some similar weather event. I think that will make it easier to show what types of data are necessary and how you would set up a data-driven disaster pre-response.

Also, if you haven't looked into the Waffle House index, know that their disaster modeling is probably worth a look. The US government uses that as an indicator in the area that Waffle Houses are common, and it's also just fascinating in general :). Southerners definitely decide what to do about hurricanes, etc. based on the behavior of local Waffle houses and also where Jim Cantori has stationed himself to broadcast the hurricane.
